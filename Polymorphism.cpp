   // Polymorphism
   //  - one name and multiple forms

   //  - eg. Virtual Functions

   /*
   Polymorphism in C++ can be of two types:

   1. Compile time polymorphism - Early Binding
      Compile time polymorphism in C++ is achieved using:
      1.1 - Function Overloading
      1.2 - Operator Overloading

   2. Run time polymorphism - Late Binding
      Run time polymorphism in C++ is achieved using:
      2.1 - Virtual Functions

      //* Late Binding DOESN'T mean that the compiler decides the function to be called at run time.
      //* It rather means ki compiler jo hai woh "function ke address se object ko associate" karta hai during "run- time" and NOT during compile time.
